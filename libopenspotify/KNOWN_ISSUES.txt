KNOWN ISSUES
============
1. The Windows event/mutex stuff in iothread.c vs request.c is broken and
   may cause deadlocks under certain conditions.
2. Loading and unloading tracks in the player too fast will cause a crash
   due to a race in player.c 
3. sp_link_create_from_string() does not support playlist URIs
4. Not all playlist APIs are actually implemented
