TODO list
=========
* Initialize PRNG
* Session
  -- Implement support for play tokens. We should send such notifications and
     stop the player if we receive them ourselves.
  -- Adhere to paths configured in sp_session_init()
  -- Caching of data
* Playlists
  -- Add support for creating/adding/modifying/removing tracks and playlists
  -- Adding an invalid playlist URI will trigger the add callback, will mark
     the playlist not loaded, and after 30 seconds the remove callback will 
     be called (libspotify 0.0.2)
* Links
  -- libspotify doesn't pull metadata on sp_link_create_from_string() for
     anything but tracks so we shouldn't either
* General
  -- Verify more functionality against libspotify
  -- Split up request processing in io requests and main thread notifications
  -- Less debugging code and output
  -- Code cleanups, naming conventions, move internal stuff out of sp_*.c


KNOWN ISSUES
============
1. Apparently there's a race between posting of requests and
   sleeping while waiting for new.. seen on Mac OS X
2. The Windows event/mutex stuff in iothread.c vs request.c is broken
3. The Windows build is currently broken after commit 8fcf56ad03bd8b5884ef41a7642b4f0c56515cfb
   The use of pthread in player.c needs to be ported to Windows APIs, VS project files needs
   to be updated and libvorbisfile needs to be built and possibly distributed with openspotify
