TODO list
=========
* Initialize PRNG
* Session
  -- Implement music decryption, decoding and the music delivery callback
  -- Implement the sp_session_player_*() API calls
  -- Adhere to paths configured in sp_session_init()
  -- Caching of data
* Playlists
  -- Add support for creating/adding/modifying/removing tracks and playlists
* Links
  -- libspotify doesn't pull metadata on sp_link_create_from_string() so we shouldn't either
* General
  -- Verify more functionality against libspotify
  -- Split up request processing in io requests and main thread notifications
  -- Less debugging code and output
  -- Code cleanups, naming conventions, move internal stuff out of sp_*.c


KNOWN ISSUES
============
1. Apparently there's a race between posting of requests and
   sleeping while waiting for new.. seen on Mac OS X
2. The Win32 event/mutex stuff in iothread.c vs request.c is broken
