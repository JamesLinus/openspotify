KNOWN ISSUES
============
1. If connecting to server fails libopenspotify the login session fails.
   The official libspotify will retry with the next server.
2. In DNS only port 4070 is listed. The official library will also try 
   port 80 and 443 I think.
3. Apparently there's a race between posting of requests and
   sleeping while waiting for new.. seen on Mac OS X
